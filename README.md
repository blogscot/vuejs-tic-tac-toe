# Vue + Parcel

This repository contains an implementation of _Tic Tac Toe_ using Vue.js and is built using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

The implementation is based on a [scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-tic-tac-toe-game-with-vue-2-part-1#toc-setup) tutorial however, I've simplified the original solution in several places to suit my own coding style.
